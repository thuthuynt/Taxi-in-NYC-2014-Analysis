An overview about the dataset provided in the link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/kentonnlp/2014-new-york-city-taxi-trips

There is 2 parts in my analytics:

**1 - OVERVIEW**
The first part is about following Trends:
1. Timerange of the dataset
2. Total trips taken per month, growth rate (MOM)
3. Total trips taken per week, growth rate (WOW)
4. Distribution of trips in a week

**2 - Trip Metrics in details**
The second part is exloring some metrics: 
1. Distribution of number passenger in a trip 
2. Trip Duration
3. Distance (m)
4. Rating
5. Speed
6. Tip amount

For further analysis, I recommend to look deeper in coordinator of pickup and dropoff (clusters) or correlation between features (number of trips, distance, duration...)
